# Sequence-Based-Functional-Annotation-of-a-Target-Gene-Protein
This project focuses on the computational identification and functional characterization of a target gene/protein using sequence analysis tools. Homology-based approaches are applied to predict structural and functional properties. The study provides insights into the biological role of the target protein through in-silico methods.
